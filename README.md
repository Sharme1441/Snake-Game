# Snake-Game
The Snake game is a text-based or console-based game where the player controls a snake that moves around a two-dimensional grid or screen. The objective is to eat food represented by a symbol (such as '*') to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls of the game area and the snake's own body.
